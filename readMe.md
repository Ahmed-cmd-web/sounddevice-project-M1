## Signals project

This project is used to demonstrate different sound frequncies that can be represented.



### Getting started

In your command line type:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```
If you are using Linux, you might not hear a sound at first when you run sd.play(). In that case, try installing ```libportaudio2``` or ```libasound-dev```
To do that on Ubuntu, run: 
```sudo apt-get install libportaudio2```
if that didn't work, run:
```sudo apt-get install libasound-dev```
